# ALX BACKEND STORAGE

This repository delves into a multifaceted array of projects that revolve around the meticulous realm of data storage implementations on the backend. In today's ever-evolving digital landscape, the efficiency, scalability, and reliability of data storage solutions form the bedrock upon which countless applications and systems are built.

## Requirements:

The following requirements must be met for this project:

### Operating System and Database Version:

- All code files should be designed to run on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
- `MySQL 5.7` (specifically, version 5.7.30) should be used as the database system.

### Formatting and Conventions:

- All code files should conclude with a new line to ensure proper formatting.
- For SQL queries, include a comment just before the query, explaining the purpose or syntax of the query.
- Each code file should commence with a comment describing the specific task or functionality it serves.
- Utilize uppercase for all SQL keywords (e.g., `SELECT`, `WHERE`, etc.) to maintain a consistent and clean coding style.

### Documentation:

- A `README.md` file is required and should be placed at the root of the project folder. This README file should contain essential information and documentation regarding the project, its purpose, and how to use it.

### Code Length Limitation:

- Ensure that the length of your code files adheres to the specified requirements. This will be evaluated using the `wc` command to maintain code clarity and readability.


By adhering to these requirements, you will ensure that your project is well-structured, readable, and compatible with the specified operating system and database version. Additionally, a comprehensive README.md file will provide essential information for anyone using or contributing to your project.
